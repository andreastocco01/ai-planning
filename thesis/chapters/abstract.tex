In this thesis, we present a novel heuristic for solving \textit{delete-free AI planning} problems.
Delete-free planning, where actions do not remove facts from the world state, offers a simplified
yet meaningful subset of classical planning. Our proposed heuristic estimates, for each action,
the cost of the shortest path required to reach a goal fact. This is complemented by a pruning
strategy that identifies and excludes actions which do not contribute to achieving the goal.

We evaluate our method against established primal heuristics on a comprehensive set of benchmark problems.
The results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance, solving the most instances and producing
higher-quality plans with greater stability across random seeds. While iterative refinement techniques
showed limited gains, the core heuristic proves to be a highly effective constructive method for delete-free
planning.
