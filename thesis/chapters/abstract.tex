In this thesis, we present a new heuristic algorithm for solving delete-free AI planning problems.
Delete-free planning, where actions do not remove facts from the world state, offers a simplified yet
meaningful subset of classical planning. We propose an algorithm that estimates goal distances by
leveraging structural properties of delete-free domains. We compare its performance against
existing heuristic approaches on a range of benchmark problems. The evaluation demonstrates that our
method achieves competitive or improved results in terms of planning time and solution quality,
highlighting its potential for use in practical planning systems.
