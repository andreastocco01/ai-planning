In this thesis, we present a new heuristic algorithm for solving delete-free AI planning problems.
Delete-free planning, where actions do not remove facts from the world state, offers a simplified yet
meaningful subset of classical planning. Our algorithm is designed to efficiently estimate goal distances
by exploiting the structural properties of delete-free domains. We compare its performance against
existing heuristic approaches on a range of benchmark problems. The evaluation demonstrates that our
method achieves competitive or improved results in terms of planning time and solution quality,
highlighting its potential for use in practical planning systems.
