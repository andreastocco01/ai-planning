\textit{Automated Planning} (or AI Planning) is a core subfield of Artificial Intelligence.
A planning problem, in general terms, can be defined as the task of finding a sequence
of actions that leads from a given initial state to a desired goal state.
While multiple formal models exist for defining planning problems, this thesis
focuses on the \textit{$SAS^+$ Formalism} defined in Definition \ref{def:sas+}

\begin{definition}[$\text{SAS}^+$ Planning Task]
	\label{def:sas+}
	A $\text{SAS}^+$ Planning Task is a 5-tuple $\Pi = \langle V, s_0, s_*, A \rangle$ with
	the following components:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \(V\): finite set of state variables \(v\),
		      each with finite domain \textit{dom(v)}
		\item \(s_0\): variable assignment defining the initial state
		\item \(s_*\): partial variable assignment defining the goal
		\item \(A\): finite set of actions (or operators),
		      where each action $a \in A$ has the following components:
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item Preconditions \textit{pre(a)}: partial variable assignment
			      \item Effects \textit{eff(a)}: partial variable assignment
			      \item Cost \textit{cost(a)}: non-negative real number
		      \end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

For an action $a \in A$ to be applicable, all of its preconditions
\textit{pre(a)} must be satisfied in the current state. Once applied, its effects
\textit{eff(a)} are used to update the current state accordingly.
